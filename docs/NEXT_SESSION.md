## Current sprint — Sprint 12 (Weeks 43–46)

**Goal:** Close A/B tests with data-driven decisions. Mobile audit. Copy pass.

**Shipped this session:**
- Persona alerts on `/dashboard` — business $5M / $10M; multi-state RE (`situs_state`)
- Planning empty states — profile-only CTAs on `/projections` + `/complete`
- **A/B collapse (no pre-launch traffic):** `personalized` upgrade copy; `score_visible` assess; removed `abTests.ts` + `app_config` A/B rows
- **EVENT_UPGRADE_COPY** — `scripts/verify-event-upgrade-copy.ts` (24/24 slugs)

**Next (Sprint 12 remaining):**
- `[ ]` Mobile nav audit (consumer public + dashboard)
- `[ ]` In-app copy audit (after A/B collapse — surfaces stable)

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

## Sprint 11 completed ✅

| Area | What shipped |
|------|----------------|
| **Planning surfaces** | `PlanningSurfaceNav`; `ScenariosExploreCard`; `/complete` uses `loadProjectionData` |
| **Charitable** | `buildPersonalizedCharitableTopics()` + `charitableTopicsUseProfileData()` gate |
| **Tier / empty state** | `/complete` tier 2; profile-only empty CTAs on projections + lifetime snapshot |

## Known limitations (do not lose between sessions)

### Anonymous cross-device attribution

`referral_clicks` has **no `user_id`** — clicks are logged anonymously at event-page visit (`POST /api/referral/track`). Per-user attribution at signup uses `funnel_events.event_slug` (`account_created` / `event_page_view`) and `profiles.referral_code` written from sessionStorage.

**Edge case:** A user who visits `/event/selling-a-business?ref=` on device A, then signs up on device B without the same sessionStorage, may have `profiles.referral_code` but no matching funnel row with `event_slug`. `pickConnectionLifeEvent()` then falls back to the latest `referral_clicks.event_slug` for that code (weak signal — may not be that user's click). **Not a launch blocker;** document if product later needs cross-device event slug persistence (e.g. `profiles.referral_event_slug` at signup).

### Advisor connection status — canonical import

Any code that checks whether an advisor–consumer link is **live** must use:

```ts
import { CONNECTED_ADVISOR_CLIENT_STATUSES } from '@/lib/advisor/clientConnectionStatus'
```

Statuses: `active`, `accepted`. Do not hardcode status strings.

### Planning empty-state CTAs (do not regress)

- **`/projections`, `/complete`:** `PLANNING_MISSING_PROJECTION_ACTIONS_TIER2` only — rows come from `computeCompleteProjection` on server render.
- **`/my-estate-strategy` (tier 3):** inline `POST /api/consumer/generate-base-case` for `projection_scenarios` / horizons.
- Do **not** merge TIER2 and TIER3 lists — see comment block in `lib/planning/planningEmptyState.ts`.
