# Consumer release smoke test (manual)

Human-runnable deploy verification. Complements automated Playwright coverage mapped in [CONSUMER_FLOWS.md §7](./CONSUMER_FLOWS.md#7-e2e-map-living-contracts); E2E does not replace this checklist for production sign-off.

Use this after a production or staging deploy when consumer write paths, estate health recompute, trust UI, transfer-strategy modeling, gifting history UI, or planning-topic copy changed (Sessions 100–127).

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes for the full checklist · ~10 minutes for the **Core** section only.

**Who:** A real test account (not a paying client). Estate tier recommended so all sections apply.

## Sprint 14 Manual Smoke Sign-off

Date: 2026-05-23  
Account: david@rolobe.resend.app (Estate tier)  
Environment: https://estate-planner-gules.vercel.app  
Tester: Manual

### Result: PASSED ✅

- **Sections 1–3:** ✅
- **Sections 4–7** (all estate routes): ✅
- **Section 8** (My Estate Strategy + Scenarios): ✅
- **Section 9** (Advisor recommendation): ⏭️ Skipped — needs linked advisor
- **Section 10** (Gifting, Strategies & Trusts): ✅ E2E 19/19 confirmed
- **Section 11** (Estate Summary planning topics): ✅

### Bugs logged and fixed

- ✅ Admin Portal visible to consumer account — fixed `f4e9160`
- ✅ Asset form save button not reachable without zoom-out — fixed `f4e9160`

### Post-launch (not blockers)

- **Sprint P-1 + P-2 (2026-06-02):** Pre-launch perf shipped (`5c24160`, `47a38f3`) — Promise.all, indexes, debounce, next/font, recommendations cache, projections cache-first, auth dedup. Re-verify dashboard TTFB after deploy; remaining ceiling is estate composition read model ([PERF_SPRINT_P1.md](./PERF_SPRINT_P1.md)).
- **Before open signups (non-code):** [LEGAL_TODO.md](./LEGAL_TODO.md) + C-4 manual Stripe walkthrough ([BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md](./BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md)); go-live day: signup → **confirm email** → login → dashboard
- E2E staging flakiness under parallel workers — re-run with `--workers=1`

### Sprint 17 — production drip verify

| Check | Due | Account |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Drip step 2 delivery | **2026-05-26** | `consumer21@rolobe.resend.app` |

Confirm step 2 email from `hello@mywealthmaps.com` after day-3 cron. Step 3 follows per `lib/emails/drip-templates.ts` schedule.

## Before you start

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| Browser | Chrome or Safari, logged out to start |
| Account | Consumer with an existing household and some assets already entered |
| Tier | **Estate (tier 3)** for My Family + Titling; **Retirement (tier 2)+** for Allocation |
| Baseline | Open **Dashboard** and note **Estate Readiness Score** (0–100) and any **Action Items** |
| Waitlist mode | If waitlist is on (default on Production), public **Get started** goes to `/waitlist` — set `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN=true` or use invite URL to test full signup (see [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md § Opening signups — go-live flip](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md#opening-signups--go-live-flip)) |

**Pass criteria for “recompute worked”:** Within ~10 seconds of a successful save, refresh Dashboard — score, gaps, or action items should **change or stay consistent** (not silently stale). If nothing ever updates after multiple saves, flag for engineering (check `RECOMPUTE_SECRET` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in Vercel — see [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md § Vercel Production env vars](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md#vercel-production-env-vars-required-before-sprint-15-go-live)).

---

## Test data setup (staging / pre-Sprint 14)

Run once per environment before acquisition sections B and D. Idempotent.

```bash
# Test attorney listing + referral_code
set -a && source .env.local && set +a && npx tsx scripts/seed-test-attorney.ts

# Playwright consumer account → estate tier (tier 3)
set -a && source .env.local && source .env.test && set +a && npx tsx scripts/seed-test-consumer-estate.ts
```

- **Attorney listing:** `test-attorney@mywealthmaps.test` — script prints `referral_code` for `?aref=` in sections B and D (known code: **6fd027d3**).
- **Attorney portal:** `test-attorney-portal@rolobe.resend.app` / `TestAttorney123!` — after seed, sign in at `/login` → `/attorney`; **Newsletter Kit** block should render (requires `profile_id` on listing).
- **Consumer:** uses `PLAYWRIGHT_CONSUMER_EMAIL` from `.env.test` — no new user created.
- **Advisor `?ref=`:** use a real `referral_code` from `advisor_directory` (no dedicated seed script).

For production go-live env vars (not seed scripts), see [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md).

## What to report when something fails

1. **URL** and what you clicked  
2. **Exact error message** (screenshot helps)  
3. Whether it happens **after refresh** or only before  
4. Browser (Chrome/Safari) and mobile vs desktop  
5. For save failures: open browser **Network** tab, find the failing request (`/api/consumer/...`), note **status code** (401, 403, 500)

---

## Related automated tests

Engineers can run `npm run test:e2e:consumer` with `.env.test` (see `playwright.config.ts`). That covers login, dashboard UI, and a subset of consumer APIs — **not** a substitute for this manual pass on a real account.

`consumer-strategy-writes.spec.ts` soft-deletes all Playwright-named `strategy_line_items` in `afterEach` on the fixture household (`PLAYWRIGHT_HOUSEHOLD_ID` / David Chen). The charitable composition case waits 2s after DAF POST then polls `POST /api/estate-composition` for up to 20s (`after > beforeTotal`) so async `afterHouseholdWrite` recompute can complete. If manual testing overlaps those scenario names (`Playwright *`, `daf`/`charitable` at `base`), re-run e2e or delete those rows before relying on estate composition totals.

For acquisition & attribution tests, the Supabase queries in sections A–D of the
"Acquisition & attribution" section above are the authoritative verification method.
No Playwright spec covers the full `?ref=` → Supabase → `profiles` path end-to-end;
manual verification is required for Sprint 14 sign-off.
