# My Wealth Maps — Production Go-Live
# Last updated: 2026-05-25 (OB-1/OB-2/AF-1 closed; handle_new_user prod migration gate; Sprint 17 go-live prep)

---

## Purpose

Single source of truth for everything required before going live on `mywealthmaps.com`.

Two sections:
1. **Product readiness gates** — feature/quality bars that must be met before any consumer sees the app
2. **Technical go-live steps** — Vercel, DNS, Resend, Search Console ops run on launch day

> ⚠️ **Go-live gate:** Section 2 does not begin until every Section 1 checkbox is checked
> AND the full CONSUMER_RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST manual pass (including the new acquisition/attribution
> rows added in Sprint 13) is signed off. No exceptions.

Do not execute Section 2 until all Section 1 items are checked.

**Related docs:** [BUSINESS_READINESS_PLAN.md](./BUSINESS_READINESS_PLAN.md) (WA business + compliance readiness) · [NEXT_SESSION.md](./NEXT_SESSION.md) · [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) · [DECISION_LOG.md](./DECISION_LOG.md)

## Section 1 — Product readiness gates

These must be complete before launch. Update status as sprints close them.

### Distribution & attribution

- [x] **Signup referral attribution** — `mwm_referral_code` and `mwm_attorney_referral_code` persisted from sessionStorage to `profiles` + `funnel_events` on account creation (`app/(auth)/signup/_signup-form.tsx`; migration `20260529000000_profiles_referral_attribution.sql`)
- [x] **Advisor referral loop proven (staging)** — sections A/C passed Sprint 13; `?ref=` → `referral_clicks` verified
- [x] **Attorney referral loop proven (staging)** — sections B/D passed Sprint 13; test listing + `?aref=` verified
- [x] **Life event context on advisor connection** — `pickConnectionLifeEvent()` at accept; `advisor_clients.connection_life_event_*`; visible on advisor client Overview (Sprint 9/10)
- [x] **Ask advisor about strategy (AF-1)** — connected consumer notifies advisor from Transfer Strategies education cards; advisor **Client Strategy Questions** on client Overview (`a255616`)

### Email drip

- [x] **All 24 event slugs have custom drip sequences** — `DripEventSlug` union + `EVENT_SEQUENCES` cover all 24 slugs (`lib/emails/drip-templates.ts`, Sprint 9)
- [x] **Age-triggered slugs in drip union** — `rmd-start-age`, `medicare-eligibility`, `social-security-timing` in union with custom sequences (age cron + drip aligned)
- [ ] **Drip smoke test on production** — trigger step 1 via event assess email capture; confirm delivery from `hello@mywealthmaps.com`; confirm steps 2 and 3 fire on schedule via cron

### Core planning loop

- [x] **RMD start age by birth year** — `getRmdStartAge` (72 / 73 / 75); advisor Retirement tab + projection/dashboard/RMD calculator aligned (verify 1960+ cohort shows age **75**)
- [x] **Business succession planning page** — minimal intake shipped (Path A); sidebar link live; tier 3 (Sprint 10)
- [x] **Invite-your-advisor onboarding** — `/onboarding/invite-advisor`; `onboarding_invite_advisor_completed_at` (Sprint 10)
- [x] **Mobile nav audit** — dashboard off-canvas drawer on `<lg` shipped (Sprint 12); full route-by-route audit post-launch
- [x] **Projections + Lifetime Snapshot** — `PlanningSurfaceNav` + distinct descriptions on each surface (Sprint 11)
- [x] **Charitable Giving empty state** — personalized topics from household when no donations (Sprint 11)
- [x] **Scenarios page discoverability** — “Open Scenarios” card on `/projections` (Sprint 11)

### A/B tests & personalization

- [x] **A/B decision criteria defined** — DECISION_LOG: `tier_upgraded`, 50 events/variant or 4 weeks, owner Alan (Sprint 10)
- [x] **`ab_upgrade_copy` collapsed** — personalized only (no pre-launch traffic); `lib/analytics/abTests.ts` removed (Sprint 12)
- [x] **`ab_assessment_gate` collapsed** — score_visible only; assess always shows scores to logged-out users (Sprint 12)
- [x] **`EVENT_UPGRADE_COPY`** — 24/24 slugs verified via `scripts/verify-event-upgrade-copy.ts` (Sprint 12)

### Segment-specific features

- [x] **Segment-specific dashboard alerts** — business $5M/$10M threshold alert; multi-state real estate probate risk alert (Sprint 12)
- [x] **Per-milestone upgrade copy** — upgrade copy (Sprint 7) + custom drip sequences for age-milestone slugs (Sprint 9)

### Quality & polish

- [x] **In-app copy audit** — dashboard, public event/assess, planning surfaces, landing, share links (Sprint 12)
- [x] **Extended smoke test written (Sprint 13)** — CONSUMER_RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md acquisition &
  attribution sections A–G (`?ref=`, `?aref=`, signup attribution, drip step 1, event slugs,
  life-event-on-connect)
- [x] **"Referral loop proven" definition confirmed** — exact Supabase queries in
  CONSUMER_RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md and DECISION_LOG.md (advisor + attorney `referral_clicks`)
- [x] **Test account seed scripts (Sprint 13)** — `seed-test-attorney.ts`, `seed-test-advisor.ts`,
  `seed-test-consumer-estate.ts` (idempotent). Run on staging before Sprint 14 smoke; codes in
  NEXT_SESSION.md § Sprint 14 test account references.
- [x] **`rmd-start-age` event copy** — hero, assess, drip, newsletter labels use birth-year range
  (72/73/75); SEO title/description may still say 73 for search intent (`lib/events/content-sprint5.ts`,
  `lib/emails/drip-templates.ts`).

- [x] **App URL in emails** — `lib/app-url.ts` `getAppUrl()` on email routes (Sprint 9)
- [x] **Digital Assets tier gate** — `FEATURE_TIERS['digital-assets'] = 2` + `UpgradeBanner` on page (Sprint 9)

### Data deletion & WCPA (Sprint C-6) ✅ verified 2026-05-25

- [x] **`deletion_audit_log` and `deletion_schedule` tables live** — `20260625120000_sprint_c6_deletion_compliance.sql` applied

- [x] **`verify:deletion` script** — `npm run verify:deletion -- --email user@example.com` — must PASS before WCPA response
- [x] **Auth table clean** — 9 accounts (4 founder + 5 `@mywealthmaps.test`); all `@rolobe.resend.app` retired
- [ ] **`verify:deletion` tested** — dry-run account deleted and verified PASS on staging/production
- [ ] **No soft-deleted Auth rows** — `SELECT … FROM auth.users WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL` returns 0 rows

### Compliance reminders (Sprint C-7) ✅ verified 2026-05-25

- [x] **`privacy_requests` table live** — `20260625170000_sprint_c7_privacy_requests.sql` applied (`due_at` DEFAULT +45 days)

- [ ] **End-to-end smoke test** — new consumer signup → household setup → assessment → email capture → drip step 1 → advisor connection → advisor portal view; all steps verified on production URL

**Sprint 14 manual smoke (2026-05-23):** Core §1–3, estate §4–7, §8, §11 **passed** on staging; §9 skipped (needs linked advisor); §10 E2E 19/19; bugs fixed `f4e9160`. See CONSUMER_RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md sign-off block.

## Section 2 — Technical go-live steps

Run these on launch day after all Section 1 gates are checked. Do not run early.

### Opening signups — go-live flip

The site is in waitlist mode by default on `VERCEL_ENV=production`. Do **not** flip `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN` until Section 1 product gates, **legal review** ([LEGAL_TODO.md](./LEGAL_TODO.md)), **C-4 manual Stripe walkthrough** ([BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md](./BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md)), and production drip smoke are signed off.

#### Pre-go-live — legal and config (before go-live day)

Complete before flipping Supabase Auth or `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN`:

- [ ] **`handle_new_user` trigger in production** — Apply `supabase/migrations/20260526000001_handle_new_user_trigger.sql` **before** flipping `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN`. Without it, new `auth.users` rows may not get a `profiles` row and onboarding breaks. Verify: sign up with a fresh email on staging after migration → `profiles` row exists with `trial_started_at`. Code on `main`: `1133b4f`.
- [ ] **Counsel sign-off** — ToS §10 (disclaimers), §11 (liability cap), §13 (arbitration). **Handoff:** flag those three sections; ask for one consolidated redline — [LEGAL_TODO.md § Counsel handoff](./LEGAL_TODO.md#counsel-handoff--how-to-send-the-tos). Apply redlines + TODO placeholder find-and-replace in **one final commit** before go-live.
- [ ] **Email aliases** — privacy@, security@, legal@ forwarding to monitored inbox
- [ ] **Stripe Dashboard** — `invoice.upcoming` webhook enabled; Customer Portal cancellation enabled; receipt emails on
- [ ] **C-4 manual walkthrough** — signup → paid → receipt → self-serve cancel ([BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md](./BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md))

#### Pre-go-live — keep Supabase Auth settings OFF

These are **runtime switches** in the Supabase Dashboard (Authentication → Settings). They take effect immediately for all **new** signups once enabled:

- Email confirmations → **OFF** until go-live
- Secure email change → **OFF** until go-live
- Minimum password length → leave at current value (not 12) until go-live

**Why:** Test accounts and seed scripts bypass email verification intentionally. Turning these on now would break local dev, preview smoke, and seeded users.

**Compliance code on `main`:** C-2b through C-5 merged — including `/auth/callback`, confirm-email flow, billing disclosures, `/privacy`, `/terms`. Safe to deploy; auth dashboard switches stay OFF until go-live day.

**Sprint C-3:** Phase 1 (RLS) `236890c`; Phase 1b + Phase 3 (auth callback, MFA, security headers) `56a4407` — **merged on `main`**. Verify on staging before go-live; no separate branch merge required.

#### Go-live sequence (exact order — do not reorder)

Run on launch day after all Section 1 gates are checked.

**1. Supabase Dashboard first**

In **Authentication → Settings**:

- [ ] Email confirmations → **ON**
- [ ] Secure email change → **ON**
- [ ] Minimum password length → **12**

**2. Verify auth callback on staging**

- [ ] Confirm production/preview build includes `/auth/callback` (on `main` since `56a4407`)
- [ ] Test signup → confirm email → login on **staging** with a fresh address

**3. Flip `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN` in Vercel Production**

- [ ] Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables → Production → `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN` = `true`
- [ ] **Redeploy** (required after Production env change)

**4. Verify signup surfaces**

- [ ] `https://mywealthmaps.com/signup` → signup form (not `/waitlist` redirect)
- [ ] `https://mywealthmaps.com` → **Get Started** → `/signup`
- [ ] `https://mywealthmaps.com/login` → still works
- [ ] `/signup?invite=…` still works for advisor/attorney/firm invites

**5. End-to-end smoke with a fresh email**

- [ ] Run **Core §1–3** on production ([CONSUMER_RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md](./CONSUMER_RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md))
- [ ] Use a **fresh email address** and confirm the full flow: signup → confirm email → login

**To re-enable waitlist mode:** remove `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN` from Vercel Production and redeploy. (Supabase auth settings can stay ON — new signups will still require verification if the env var is removed and waitlist redirect is active.)

**Implementation:** `lib/waitlist-mode.ts`, `middleware.ts` (runtime `/signup` → `/waitlist` redirect; renamed from `proxy.ts` in `3ceb125` to fix Next.js Turbopack empty middleware manifest), `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` (backup redirect), `app/(public)/waitlist/`, `getSignupHref()` on public CTAs.

**Pre-launch (current):** waitlist is on by default on Vercel Production — no env vars required. Optionally set `WAITLIST_MODE=true` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_MODE=true` for explicit control or local dev. Invite/token signups bypass the gate: `?invite=`, `?invite_token=` + `?firm_id=`, `?connectionToken=`.

### Code

- [x] **`app/robots.ts`** — permissive rules deployed at `https://mywealthmaps.com/robots.txt` (2026-05-24)
- [x] **`app/layout.tsx`** — no change needed; Search Console verified via Cloudflare (meta tag env not required)
- [x] **UX Language Audit (Sprint C-2b)** — All consumer-facing strings audited; `audit-ux-language.sh` 0 findings; all `DISCLAIMER_STRINGS` surfaces wired. Completed: 2026-05-24 (`788aa08`)
- [x] **RLS security (Sprint C-3 Phase 1)** — `20260602000000_sprint_c3_rls_fixes.sql` applied or ready to push; advisor joins `active` + `accepted`. Completed: 2026-06-02 (`236890c`)
- [x] **Auth + security (Sprint C-3 Phase 1b + Phase 3)** — `/auth/callback`, confirm-email, MFA middleware, security headers, PII logging. Completed: 2026-06-02 (`56a4407`)
- [x] **Billing disclosures (Sprint C-4 — code)** — RCW 19.316, FTC cancel, renewal reminders (`462bda9`). **Manual:** Stripe Dashboard + walkthrough — [BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md](./BILLING_DISCLOSURES_SPRINT.md)
- [x] **Privacy + Terms (Sprint C-5 — code)** — `/privacy`, `/terms`, footer links, sitemap (`2e1dff3`, `695a860`). **Manual:** [LEGAL_TODO.md](./LEGAL_TODO.md) — placeholders + counsel sign-off

### Vercel Production env vars (Sprint 15 go-live — verified 2026-05-24)

Set in **Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables → Production**, then redeploy.
Check each row in the dashboard before domain cutover. Full matrix is the **go-live source of truth**
for ops (also in [MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](./MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md#production-environment-variables-sprint-15-go-live)).

| Variable | Where it's needed | Status to verify |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Sitemap, drip links, referral URLs, estate-health recompute `fetch` | ✅ `https://mywealthmaps.com` (2026-05-24) |
| `RECOMPUTE_SECRET` | Estate health recompute after consumer/strategy saves (`afterHouseholdWrite`) | ✅ Verified (2026-05-24) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Email drip delivery (`/api/email/drip`, capture flows) | ✅ Verified (2026-05-24) |
| `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | Drip + cron internal calls (server-to-server auth) | ✅ Verified (2026-05-24) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | All Vercel crons (`notifications`, `age-triggers`, `process-deletions`, `compliance-reminders`) | ✅ Verified (2026-05-24) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Client-side Supabase (browser, Playwright) | ✅ Verified (2026-05-24) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-side admin queries (webhooks, drip, signup side effects) | ✅ Verified (2026-05-24) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` | Search Console meta tag in `app/layout.tsx` | **Not needed** — verified via Cloudflare domain provider (2026-05-24) |
| `WAITLIST_MODE` | `middleware.ts` + server signup redirect | Optional — default on in Production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_MODE` | Client `getSignupHref()` CTAs | Optional — redeploy when changed |
| `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN` | Opens public signup at go-live | **Pending** — legal review + C-4 manual verify + Stripe production |
| `COMPLIANCE_EMAIL` | `/api/cron/compliance-reminders` ops alerts (overdue deletions, WCPA SLAs) | ✅ `avoels@comcast.net` (2026-05-25) |

**Checklist (Production environment only):**

- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` → `https://mywealthmaps.com` (2026-05-24)
- [x] `RECOMPUTE_SECRET` → matches local secret; recompute smoke passes after deploy (2026-05-24)
- [x] `RESEND_API_KEY` → confirmed set (2026-05-24)
- [x] `INTERNAL_API_KEY` → confirmed set on Vercel Production (2026-05-24)
- [x] `CRON_SECRET` → confirmed set (2026-05-24)
- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → confirmed set (2026-05-24)
- [x] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → confirmed set (2026-05-24)
- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` → **not needed**; Search Console verified via Cloudflare (2026-05-24)
- [ ] **Open signups:** set `PUBLIC_SIGNUP_OPEN=true` → redeploy → confirm `/signup` open (go-live day — after legal + C-4 manual verify)

**Not required in Vercel Production:**

- `SUPABASE_URL` — used only by local/staging seed scripts (`seed-test-attorney.ts`,
  `seed-test-advisor.ts`, `seed-test-consumer-estate.ts`). Vercel’s Supabase integration sets URL/keys;
  do not add a separate `SUPABASE_URL` for production deploys.

**Seed scripts (staging / local only — not Vercel env):**

```bash
set -a && source .env.local && source .env.test && set +a
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-advisor.ts
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-attorney.ts
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-consumer-estate.ts
```

### Domain & DNS

- [x] **Custom domain** — `mywealthmaps.com` attached in Vercel and SSL active (2026-05-24)
- [x] **DNS cutover** — A/CNAME records pointing to Vercel (2026-05-24)
- [x] **Redeploy** after `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` change — sitemap, drip links, referral URLs all use this value (2026-05-24)

### Resend (email)

- [x] **Verify domain** `mywealthmaps.com` in Resend — SPF/DKIM DNS records added and verified (2026-05-24)
- [x] **Confirm `from` address** — `hello@mywealthmaps.com` in `app/api/email/drip/route.ts` (2026-05-24)
- [x] **Confirm any other Resend sends** use verified domain (2026-05-24)

### Search Console

- [x] **Add property** — URL-prefix for `https://mywealthmaps.com` (2026-05-24)
- [x] **Verify ownership** — via Cloudflare domain provider (not meta tag / `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`) (2026-05-24)
- [x] **Submit sitemap** — Sitemaps → `https://mywealthmaps.com/sitemap.xml` → Submit (2026-05-24)
- [x] **Spot-check indexing requests** — manually request indexing for priority event URLs: `/event/selling-a-business`, `/event/death-of-spouse`, `/event/approaching-retirement`, `/event/estate-tax-law-change`, `/event/serious-diagnosis` (2026-05-24)

### Supabase prod migrations (confirm applied)

**Current (2026-05-25):** **76+** timestamped migration files in `supabase/migrations/` (excludes `VERIFY_session27_migrations.sql` and `reference/`). Local and remote in sync through `20260625170000` (C-7) **plus** pending prod apply for onboarding/AF-1-era migrations below.

- [ ] **`20260526000000_onboarding_wizard_fields.sql`** — OB-1 wizard columns; apply before OB-1 deploy
- [ ] **`20260526000001_handle_new_user_trigger.sql`** — **Required before open signups** — `on_auth_user_created` → `handle_new_user()` (`trial_started_at`, not legacy `trial_ends_at`)
- [x] Through `20260601000000_advisor_directory_referral_code_trigger.sql` (Sprint 13 verify)
- [x] Final prod spot-check before Sprint 15 go-live (2026-05-24)
- [x] Attorney referral code trigger: `attorney_listings_referral_code_trigger` (Sprint 8; backfill via `seed-test-attorney.ts` if absent) (2026-05-24)
